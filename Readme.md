___
### Apply Seam Carving Algorithm In Pure Python With Ability To Compare Two Images(Before\After), Show Seams,Minimum Seam, History of Removed Seams, Energy Map and Save the Result Images.
### Choose Number of Seams and Which Kind (Vertical\Horizontal\both) of Seams You want to Extract.
### You can just drag&drop files to start.
